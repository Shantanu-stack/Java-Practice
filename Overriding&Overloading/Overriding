###  Java Method Overriding ##
Declaring a method in sub class which is already in parent class. So that a child class can give it's own implementation.

Animal.java  // Parent Class
public class Animal {
    void speak(){
        System.out.println("The animal speaks ");
    }
}

Dog.java
public class Dog extends Animal{
    @Override
    void speak(){
        System.out.println("The dog barks!! ");
    }
}

Tester1.java
public class Tester1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.speak();
        Animal an = new Animal();
        an.speak();
    }
}
Here Dog.java is a child class which has it's own implenmentation that's why we write @override to indicate it.
