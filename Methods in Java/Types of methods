## Method overloading in java 
Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, 
provided their parameter lists are different. It enhances the readability and usability of the program.

package com.practice;

public class sum {
    public int sum(int x, int y){
        return x+y;

    }
    public int sum(int x, int y, int z){
        return x+y+z;
    }
    public int sum(int x, int y, int z, int a){
        return x+y+z+a;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        sum s = new sum();  /// here we are creating an object instance new sum() creates new instance object
        System.out.println("THe sum of two numbers is " +s.sum(3,6));
        System.out.println("THe sum of three numbers is " +s.sum(7,8,9));
        System.out.println("THe sum of four numbers is " +s.sum(5,5,7,9));
    }
}
