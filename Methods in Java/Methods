## Methods ##
A method in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task. Methods allow you to organize your code into reusable chunks, making it easier to read, maintain, and debug.
Key Components of a Method
i) Method Declaration: This includes the method's name, return type, and parameters.
ii) Method Body: This contains the code that defines what the method does.

## Example 1
package polymorphism;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class rectangleis {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the lenght please");
        int length = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(" Enter the Breadth please ");
        int breadth = sc.nextInt();
      
        perimeterect(length, breadth);
        sc.close();
    }
    public static void perimeterect(int length, int breadth){
        double perimeter = 2*(length + breadth);
        System.out.println("The perimeter is " +perimeter);
    }
}
