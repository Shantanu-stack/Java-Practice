##///Notes of inheritance 
-It is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object 
-Allows new classess to be created based on existing ones. 
- class Subclass extends Superclass {
   // New features and behavior specific to the subclass
 }
- Subclass inherits attributes and method from the parent class. Parent class is the Superclass

Let's take a example 
Input:- 
Main.java
package inheritance;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.go();  // calling method 
        car.stop();
        System.out.println("The wheels in the car are ");
        System.out.println(car.wheels);
    }
}

Vehicle.java
package inheritance;

public class Vehicle {
    double speed;

    void go(){   // creating a method 
        System.out.println("This vehicle is moving ");   

    }
    void stop(){
        System.out.println("THe vehicle is stopped ");
    }
}

Car.java
package inheritance;

public class Car extends Vehicle{
int wheels = 4;
int doors = 4;
}

Bicycle.java
package inheritance;

public class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
 int Wheels = 2;
 int Pedals = 2;

}

Here Main.java in the tester file and Vehicle.java is the parent class of the bicyle and car file the output of the following code would be like this 

This vehicle is moving 
THe vehicle is stopped 
The wheels in the car are 
4

### Types of Inheritance supported by java 
1)Single Inheritance
2)Multilevel Inheritance
3) Heirarchical Inheritance
4) Multiple Inheritance
5) Hybrid Inheritance
